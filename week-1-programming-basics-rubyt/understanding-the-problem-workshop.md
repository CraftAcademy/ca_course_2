We are in the business of solving different kind of problems with software. A program is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a computer to solve some problem or perform a specified task. In order to know what instructions to include in our programs, we need to gain an understanding of why our program is...

## Capturing requirements

The very first thing we need to do in a project is to try to fully understand the problem we are solving as well as the scope of the problem. Let's start with defining these two terms and then take a closer look at what we are dealing with in the context of the ATM Challenge.

### Get to work - Go Agile

Employing Agile practices in Software Development is an excellent way to incrementally deliver solutions, ensuring that user needs are kept front and center throughout the entire design and development process. Once you’ve stepped back and identified the true nature of the problem to be solved, you and your team can leverage on agile best-practicies to incrementally build out the solution.

#### The Problem definition

A Problem definition is the explicit written statement of the problem. Creating a good problem definition is a very important process. Working without it leads to waste of time and effort. 

> If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.

To create a good problem definition we must dig deep and find out what is the root cause of the problem given to us, the real problem.

A good problem definition is:

* written down and shared;
* explicitly defines the current state and the desired state;
* measurable, so we know if and when we achieved it;
* short;
* not over constrained.



#### Tell a story

A well-told user story starts a conversation. A user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a  system that define what has to be built in the project. The goal with defining user stories is to capture the requirements needed to deliver a solution to the problem definition.

#### Draw a Picture

## Naming is a process, not a single step

Don't be afraid to change your mind. Quite often, as your system evolves with more use cases and features  implemented, the names of your classes, methods and attributes might prove irrelevant or illogical. That is perfectly normal and an integrated part of the refactoring process is to review and refine your naming.
