# Coding as a Craft 2.0

Craft Academy is a 12-week intensive, practice-oriented course for aspiring junior developers. The course is delivered as a on-site, coach led coding bootcamp. It gives you the basics you need to create, develop and launch web-based applications.

Craft Academy is the first programming bootcamp in Sweden. We emphasize test-driven development and Agile methodologies and pride ourselves on providing an education that prepares students to work in the real world, and not on whiteboards.

The concept of Craft Academy Bootcamp is simple, it is a 12 week intensive coding camp, aimed at teaching you the fundamentals of web development, enabling you to hit the ground running â€“ and keep running. But what is important is that modern engineering practices are considered to be part of this foundation. As a student, you work from day one with **automated testing**, **continuous integration and deployment**, and other essential skills. This means that when our learners enter the workforce and are faced with problem, their instinct will be to solve right rather than just hack a solution together.
